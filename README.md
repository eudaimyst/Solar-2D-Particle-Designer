# Solar-2D-Particle-Designer
To adjust and save Solar2D emitter paramaters on the fly
Windows binary and HTML5 available at: https://skipgamer.itch.io/solar-2d-particle-designer

Features:

Can create particle emitters and a settings window to adjust parameters

Particle parameters can be output to json (saved in documents folder on Win32) or to a text list to be copied and pasted straight into code and passed to an emitter

Loading emitter parameters in the same formats

Collapsible and closable settings windows

Opportunities for improvement:

(!) Background adjustment and support for display objects to be added to the scene

(!) Support for loading additional textures from a folder

(*) Color pickers and sliders

(*) Random generation of emitter parameters

(*) Moving emitters (point to point, radial, easing, etc...)

Parameter profiles / defaults

Timed spawning of emitters for finer control of duration
( ! = coming certainly, * = if I have the time to keep working on this or if people actually want to use it )
